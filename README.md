# A Deep Learning Approach to Understanding Human Cognition Through iEEG-Video Analysis

## Abstract 

Intracranial Electroencephalography (iEEG) provides a high-resolution, non-invasive method for directly recording neural activity from the human brain. This technique offers a unique opportunity to study complex cognitive processes with unprecedented temporal and spatial precision. In this study, we leverage the power of deep learning to model and interpret iEEG data, aiming to gain insights into the underlying neural mechanisms of human cognition.

By applying advanced deep learning techniques to iEEG data, we seek to develop accurate models that can decode cognitive states and predict behavior. Furthermore, we aim to utilize interpretability methods to delve into the inner workings of these models, shedding light on the neural representations learned by the network. This approach may ultimately contribute to a deeper understanding of the relationship between neural activity and cognitive function.
